                                                                                  Wrapper Class
                                                                                  
<b>It is inbuild class in java.</b> <br>
  -used to convert primitive datatype to non primitive type value i.e object
  -java is not 100% object oriented programming language due to 8 primitive datatype
  -to make java 100% object oriented programming language we are taking help of wrapper class
  -for every primitve datatype there is respective wrapper class 

        Wrapper class Classifed into following types
        
        primitive Datatype              WrapperClass
        byte                             Byte
        short                            Short
        int                              Integer
        long                             Long
        double                           Double
        char                             Char
        boolean                          Boolean
        
        
        
        To convert Primitve Data type to non Primitive data type we take help of following
      1.Boxing 
      2.UnBoxing
      3.Parsing


Boxing: process of Converting Primitive Type values to their respective non primitive values is known as BOXING
we have 3 ways to perform BOXING :
   a.Creating Object using literal way
   b.using valueOf()
   c.using new keyword

   a.Creating Object using literal way:
   -it is known as autoBoxing  
   eg Integer i=10;
