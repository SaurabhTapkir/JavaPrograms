                                                              Collection
Collection Framework is structure which allows programmer to store group of object
we can store heterogeneous type of data. 

Quest. Why we are preferring  Collection over an array?
      Size of array is fixed we cannot change size of array during execution of programme
      Size of collection is dynamically increases when programmer keep adding elements to collection
