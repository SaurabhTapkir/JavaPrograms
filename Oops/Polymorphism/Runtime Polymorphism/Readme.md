                                                                                 RunTime Polymorphism

The process of binding between Method call statment and method implementation during Run Time Is called as Runtime polymorphism
  It is also called as  Dynamic Binding or Late Binding 
<b>RunTime Polymorphism Classified into Two types: <br>
  
    1.Derived Type Casting:
      it is process of Converting refernce(address )of one class to another class.
      It is depends on primiitve Type casting.
      Non Primitive Type Casting Classify into two type:
      1.Upcasting :process of converting address from child class to its parent class 
                   we need to create an object for child class  and pass reference to parent class
                   create an obj to its parent class and pass ref from child class
    
    2.Downcasting:-Process of Converting Addres from Parent class to child class
                    we cannot perform this automatically
                    we need to take help of Cast Operator 
                    we need to create object of child class , so we can easily load and access  all members of it's own  class and its parent class
