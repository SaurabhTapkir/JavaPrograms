                                                                                          Derived TypeCasing
Deived TypeCasting Process of Converting address of from one class to another class is known as Dervied Type Casting
it has two types:
 1.Upcasting :process of converting address from child class to its parent class 
                   we need to create an object for child class  and pass reference to parent class
                   create an obj to its parent class and pass ref from child class
    
  2.Downcasting:-Process of Converting Addres from Parent class to child class
                    we cannot perform this automatically
                    we need to take help of Cast Operator 
                    we need to create object of child class , so we can easily load and access  all members of it's own  class and its parent class
