It is Blue print of Class 
with help of Interface we can Perform 100% Abstraction.
 means we don't need to use abstract keyword as it is implemented internally  

 Syntax: 
  Interface Interface_name 
  {
  }
  eg .
  Interface demo()
   {
  
   }

   program->
   interface demo{
   void demo();
   void test();
   void test(int n);
   }
